	void AdvanceDays(int NumDays);
	//Modify the date by advancing it "NumDays" days into the future.
	//Basic approach for implementing AdvanceDays: 
	//The easiest way to advance the current date some (non-negative) NumDays days 
	//	into the future is to use a loop that repeats for NumDays iterations. 
	//	Inside the loop, write your C++ code such that it can correctly 
	//	just advance the date one day into the future on each iteration of the loop. 
	//Note that in the is approach 
	//	(i) you need to precisely detect whether the current date is in the end of the month, 
	//		and be careful especially about February since it depends on whether it is a leap year, 
	//	(ii) when it is not the end of the month advancing one day into the future is very easy, but 
	//	(iii) when it is the end of the month, you have to carefully advance the date into 
	//		the first day of the next month, be careful especially when it is December 31.

	void BackDays(int NumDays);
	//Modify the date by pushing it back "NumDays" days into the past.
	//The easiest way to back down the current date some (non-negative) NumDays days 
	//	into the past is to use a loop that repeats for NumDays iterations. 
	//	Inside the loop, write your C++ code such that it can correctly just back down the date 
	//	one day into the past on each iteration of the loop. 
	//Note that in the is approach 
	//	(i) you need to precisely detect whether the current date is in the beginning of the month, 
	//	(ii) when it is not the beginning of the month backing down one day into the past is very easy, but 
	//	(iii) when it is the beginning of the month, you have to carefully back down the date into 
	//		the very last day of the previous  month, and you need to be careful 
	//		especially when it is Jan. 1 or March 1 (since the previous day could be Feb. 28 or Feb 29 
	//		depending on whether it is a leap year).

	bool IsValidDate(int Month, int Day, int Year);
	//Check the input date to make sure it is a valid date.
	//You can reuse what you did in Programming #3 and #5C in CSCI 105 last semester to 
	//	implement this member function. 
	//Essentially, you need to use the if statement or the switch statement to check to return true 
	//	only when the value in the data member day falls in the range of 
	//	(i) 1 to 31 if the data member month  indicates a month of 31 days, or 
	//	(ii) 1 to 30 if the data member month  indicates a month of 30 days, or 
	//	(iii) 1 to 28 if the data member month  indicates it is February while 
	//		the data member year  indicates it is not a leap year, or 
	//	(iv) 1 to 29 if the data member month  indicates it is February while 
	//		the data member year  indicates it is a leap year.
	//
	//How to determine leap years: 
	//	A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 except that 
	//		any year divisible by 100 is a leap year only if it is also divisible by 400. 
	//		So 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is. 
	//	In other words, 
	//		(i) a year (e.g. 1996) is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, 
	//		(ii) a year (e.g. 2000) is a leap year if it is divisible by 400, 
	//		(iii) otherwise, it is not a leap year.
